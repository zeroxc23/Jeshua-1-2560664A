    I'm diggin' myself out of this graveyard
Diggin' myself out, out of this graveyard
Out of this graveyard, graveyard, graveyard
Nothing but misery and loneliness
Under this ground
Surrounded by skeletons
That were lost and never found
Buried in complacency, but it's time for me to get out
When it's time to leave the dead things behind
I'm feeling my heartbeat now
(I'm feeling my heartbeat now)
I'm diggin' myself out of this graveyard
Diggin' myself out of this graveyard
A shovel in my hand, ready to stand again
Diggin' myself out, out of this graveyard
Out of this graveyard, graveyard, graveyard
Looking back into this grave I see
There's a pale, cold lifeless version of me
But I'm finally out of this hole, reclaim my soul
Filling all the vacancy with the new world that I found
And it's time to leave the dead things behind
I'm feeling my heartbeat now
(I'm feeling my heartbeat now)
I'm diggin' myself out of this graveyard
Diggin' myself out of this graveyard
A shovel in my hand, ready to stand again
Diggin' myself out, out of this graveyard
I'm ringing the bell
Six feet further from hell
I'm ringing the bell
Six feet further from hell
I'm diggin' myself out of this graveyard
Diggin' myself out of this graveyard
A shovel in my hand, ready to stand again
Diggin' myself out, out of this graveyard
Out of this graveyard, graveyard, graveyard
Out of this graveyard
Pain without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
You're sick of feeling numb
You're not the only one
I'll take you by the hand
And I'll show you a world that you can understand
This life is filled with hurt
When happiness doesn't work
Trust me and take my hand
When the lights go out, you'll understand
</p>

Pain without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Anger and agony are better than misery
Trust me, I've got a plan
When the lights go up, you'll understand
Pain without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd like to feel pain than nothing
Rather feel pain
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
That you're wounded
You know, you know, you know, you know
That I'm here to save you
You know, you know, you know, you know
I'm always here for you
I know, I know, I know, I know
That you'll thank me later
Pain without love
Pain, can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Rather feel pain than nothing at all

        <p>Suffocate everything, they complicate everything
            They steal your fate everyday but you can't believe it
            Take yourself far away from nothingness
            A million miles from emptiness
            Suffocate everything, they complicate everything
            They steal your fate everyday but you can't believe it
            Take yourself far away from nothingness
            A million miles from emptiness
            Remember the days of the innocence
            Before it came in waves
            Remember the trust it was blown away
            Into oblivion
            Remember love, remember hate
            Remember everything they said just to break you again
            Remember all, all of your enemies
            Forever and ever they
            Suffocate everything, they complicate everything
            They steal your fate everyday but you can't believe it
            Take yourself far away from nothingness
            A million miles from emptiness
            And leave it all behind you (behind you, behind you)
            Forget the decay
            And the endlessness of all of our mistakes
            Forget all the blame and the apathy
            And throw it all away
            Forget the pain, forget the hate
            Forget all your enemies
            They never will break you again
            Suffocate everything, they complicate everything
            They steal your fate everyday but you can't believe it
            Take yourself far away from nothingness
            A million miles from emptiness
            And leave it all behind you
            Oh, ooh oh, ooh oh
